A message queue is a linked list of messages stored within the kernel and identified by a message queue identifier. A new queue is created or an existing queue opened by msgget().
New messages are added to the end of a queue by msgsnd(). Every message has a positive long integer type field, a non-negative length, and the actual data bytes (corresponding to the length), all of which are specified to msgsnd() when the message is added to a queue. Messages are fetched from a queue by msgrcv(). We donâ€™t have to fetch the messages in a first-in, first-out order. Instead, we can fetch messages based on their type field.
